# Encapsulation

* Hiding "sensitive" information/data fom outside access.
* It's a process of wrapping information/data into a single piece.
* Two Rules :
  1. Declare class attribute/variaqbles as private.
  2. Use GET & SET method to access &  update the private attributes/variables.
* Example: [12_Object Oriented Programming/TestEncapsulation.java](https://github.com/ejdotp/SemFour_ITER/blob/main/Computer%20Science%20%26%20Workshop%202/12_Object%20Oriented%20Programming/TestEncapsulation.java)
