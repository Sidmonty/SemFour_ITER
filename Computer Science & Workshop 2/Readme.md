# Encapsulation

* Hiding "sensitive" information/data fom outside access.
* It's a process of wrapping information/data into a single piece.
* Two Rules :
  1. Declare class attribute/variaqbles as private.
  2. Use GET & SET method to access &  update the private attributes/variables.
* Example: /12_Object Oriented Programming/TestEncapsulation.java
